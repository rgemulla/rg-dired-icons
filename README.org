* rg-dired-icons
Dired minor mode that displays file and directory icons for Windows. Also provides utility functions for extracting, displaying, and caching icons.

Icons are determined using the filename extension. Given an extension, rg-dired-icons searches the Windows registry for the program associated with the extension, extracts the icon, and displays it. Once extracted, icons are cached so that the mode is quite efficient.

** Prerequisites
- [[http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/][ResourceHacker]] (to extract icons)
- [[https://www.imagemagick.org/][ImageMagick 6]] (to convert icons)

** Installation
1. Install the package
2. Add the ResourceHacker installation directory to the system path or set  ~rg/icons-resource-hacker-directory~ to that directory (with a trailing /)
3. Add the ImageMagick installation directory to the system path (important:
   before =Windows/System32=) or set ~rg/icons-imagemagick-directory~ to that
   directory (with a trailing /)
4. Add ~(require 'rg-dired-icons)~ to your Emacs configuration

Now you can turn on and off icons via ~M-x rg/dired-icons-mode~. 

Here is an example configuration:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(when (string-equal system-type "windows-nt")
  ;; Example: use Cygwin's ImageMagick
  (let ((cygwin-path1 (remove-if-not
                       '(lambda (d) (string-match-p "cygwin\\(..\\)?/bin" d))
                       exec-path)))
    (when cygwin-path1
      (setq cygwin-path (concat (car cygwin-path1) "/"))
      (setq rg/icons-imagemagick-directory cygwin-path)))

  ;; Example: ResourceHacker installed in ~/.emacs.d/ResourchHacker
  (setq rg/icons-resource-hacker-directory
        (expand-file-name (concat user-emacs-directory "ResourceHacker/")))

  ;; Now load the package and (optionally) switch icons on by default
  (require 'rg-dired-icons)
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'rg/dired-icons-mode))
#+END_SRC
** Refreshing icons
- Icon resolutions are selected to exactly match the font size. When the font size or text scale is changed in Emacs, icons sizes may be incorrect. Simply refresh the dired buffer to fix this.
- When no suitable icon for a file can be determined, a default icon is shown.
- rg-dired-icons caches all icons on disk and in memory. When file associations change, the cache may be out of sync and show outdated icons. When you installed an application that handles a file type that was previously unhandled, run ~M-x rg/icons-clear-memory-cache~ and refresh. When you changed the application that handles a file type, run ~M-x rg/icons-clear-cache~.
** Known issues
- ImageMagick v7 is (yet) unsupported
- Currently only tested with Cygwin's version of ImageMagick
